Target-independent work belongs in [`SakuraiTsubaki/Decompilation`](https://github.com/SakuraiTsubaki/Decompilation).

## Start here

1. Complete [`PROJECT.md`](PROJECT.md) and [`config/target.json`](config/target.json).
2. Begin a focused record from [`research/template.md`](research/template.md).
3. Promote reproducible conclusions through [`analysis/template.md`](analysis/template.md).
4. Commit every storable non-ROM result produced or collected during the work.
5. Run `python scripts/check_repository.py .` and the unit tests.

## Storage rule

Only original, modified, or rebuilt ROM binaries—and equivalent complete game-image/package binaries—are excluded from GitHub. Commit all other storable work products: analysis, research, reports, documents, scripts, source, tools, settings, logs, manifests, checklists, tables, CSV/JSON/YAML, graphics, sprites, images, palettes, fonts, icons, tiles, converted data, patches, and validation material.

Graphics and sprite work must include actual viewable PNG output in addition to data and metadata. See [ARTIFACT_POLICY.md](ARTIFACT_POLICY.md).

Secrets, credentials, and private keys are not work products and must not be committed.
